## Program Description <a name="program-description"></a>

This is a simple hangman game that I have coded using React.js and CSS. 

The program fetches a random word from an API, and hides each of the letters. 

The player selects letters via an onscreen keyboard, as the player guesses correct letters, the corresponding letters are revealed, and if the player selects incorrect letters , the image in the game changes and shows the stick figure getting one step closer to being a hanged man. 

The game ends once the player has correctly guessed the word or has run out of guesses. 


## Features <a name="features"></a>
- Reactive design that adapts to screen size due to the use of CSS media queries. 
- Randomly generated hidden words, created with the use of an API. 
- Conditional rendering that is used to reset the game. 
- A functional on-screen keyboard generated by mapping an array. 
- Pictures, Stats and messages that are updated throughout the game thanks to JavaScript. 
- A pop-up that displays the rules once a "help" button is clicked.

5. Once this has finished installing, you can start the game by running the following "npm start".
6. This will usually automatically open a web browser and launch the program. However, you can open it yourself if you go to "http://localhost:3000" in a browser.

#### Any feedback would be appreciated.
